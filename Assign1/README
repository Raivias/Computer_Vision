---Includes---
Source code files:
	Part1.cpp
	Part2.cpp
Name of execuables
	Part1
	Part2
Input and Output images:
	mri -input image 256 256
	mri_part1 -output image 128 256
	mri_part2 -output image 128 128

---Running Part 1---
1) run 'make clean' to clear up any prebuilt objects
2) run 'make Part1'
3) run the executable which takes 3 variables
	image - file path of the image you want to use
	length - how many rows there are in the image
	width - how many entries per column
	enter ./Part1 image length width
	example: ./Part1 mri 256 256
4) the new image will open automatically but can also be opened by entering
	"(echo P5; echo 'width/2' 'length'; echo 255; cat 'image'_part1)|xv -&"
	where the items in quotes refer to the variables you input into step 3

---Running Part 2---
1) run 'make clean' to clear up any prebuilt objects
2) run 'make Part2'
3) run the executable which takes 3 variables
	image - file path of the image you want to use
	length - how many rows there are in the image
	width - how many entries per column
	enter ./Part2 image length width
	example: ./Part2 mri 256 256
4) the new image will open automatically but can also be opened by entering
	"(echo P5; echo 'width/2' 'length'; echo 255; cat 'image'_part2)|xv -&"
	where the items in quotes refer to the variables you input into step 3
